Execute Phase 10: Prototype (CAIO Repository)

⚠️ IMPORTANT: You previously executed Phase 10 in the WRONG repository (VerbumFieldEngine). You MUST clean up that work first, then proceed with CAIO.

Read and execute the detailed plan at docs/prompts/codex-phase-10-prototype.md.

The plan includes cleanup instructions for VerbumFieldEngine work. Complete cleanup first, then implement CAIO Phase 10.

Plan Reference: plan:EXECUTION_PLAN:10

You are approved to implement. Execute immediately - do not propose, do not wait for approval. Follow all instructions in the detailed prompt document.

CRITICAL: You are working in the CAIO repository (/Users/smarthaus/Projects/GitHub/CAIO), NOT VerbumFieldEngine.
