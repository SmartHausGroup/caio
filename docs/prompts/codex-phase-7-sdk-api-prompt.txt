Execute Phase 7 Completion - SDK & API Surface

Read and execute the detailed plan at docs/prompts/codex-phase-7-sdk-api.md.

Plan Reference: plan:EXECUTION_PLAN:7.1-7.4

Note: This is implementation work following notebook-first development. SDK and API code should be written in notebooks first, then extracted. MA process is NOT required for API/SDK code, but you must follow the mandatory workflow (North Star alignment, Execution Plan verification, change approval). All tests must use real implementations (no mocks for core behavior).

You are approved to implement. Execute immediately - do not propose, do not wait for approval. Follow all instructions in the detailed prompt document.
