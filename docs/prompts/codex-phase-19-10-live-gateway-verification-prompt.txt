You are Codex, the Lead Engineer for CAIO.

**Goal:** Execute **Phase 19.10: Live Gateway Verification**.
**Plan Reference:** `plans/phase-19-10-live-gateway-verification/phase-19-10-live-gateway-verification.md`

We need to prove the Universal Gateway works with *real* external services. We will create a live verification test suite that only runs when keys are present.

### Tasks

1.  **Create Live Test Suite:**
    - Create `tests/integration/test_live_gateway_verification.py`.
    - Implement tests for:
        - `tavily` (Search)
        - `openai_embeddings` (Embeddings)
        - `elevenlabs` (Voice)
    - **Crucial:** Each test must use `pytest.mark.skipif` to check for `LIVE_TESTS_ENABLED=1` AND the specific API key.
    - **Assertion:** Verify not just HTTP 200, but that `GatewayResponse` contains valid data and `guarantees` (latency, cost) are populated.

2.  **Verify Adapter Implementation:**
    - Check `caio/gateway/adapters/tier3_search.py` (or similar) to ensure `TavilyAdapter` is implemented.
    - Check `caio/gateway/adapters/tier3_embeddings.py` to ensure `OpenAIEmbeddingsAdapter` is implemented.
    - If missing, implement them now.

3.  **Run Verification (Dry Run):**
    - Run the tests. They should all SKIP (unless you have keys in env).
    - This proves the harness is correct.

4.  **Document:**
    - Create `docs/gateway/ADAPTER_VERIFICATION.md`.
    - Log the status of these adapters as "Verification Suite Created".

### Constraints
- Do NOT hardcode any API keys.
- Do NOT mock the network calls in this suite—we want real integration.
- Ensure `GatewayExecutor` is used exactly as the Orchestrator would use it.
